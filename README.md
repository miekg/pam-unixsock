# pam-unixsock

pam_unixsock is PAM module to send credentials to a unix socket. See pam_unixsock.8.md for more
information.

Requirements
------------

* The LibPAM development headers (libpam-dev or libpam0g-dev)
* A PAM-based system (currently only tested on Linux)

Source Install
--------------

    make clean
    make all

And then copy it to:

    cp pam_unixsock.so /lib/security

Or for Ubuntu

    cp pam_unixsock.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security

Testing
-------

Create a fake pam service called `unixsock`:

~~~
% cat /etc/pam.d/unixsock
#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     pam_unixsock.so
~~~

Open a reader on the socket:

~~~
# nc -lU /var/run/pam_unix.sock
~~~

Use pamtester to authenticate yourself; you can just use a fake password here.

~~~
% sudo pamtester unixsock $USER authenticate
~~~
